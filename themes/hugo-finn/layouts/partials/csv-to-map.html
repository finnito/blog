Returns a slice of maps from a CSV file.

This partial resolves internal paths by looking for a matching:

  1. Page resource (a file in the current page bundle)
  2. Section resource (a file in the current section)
  3. Global resource (a file in the assets directory)

It skips the section resource lookup if the current page is a leaf bundle, and
captures external files as resources.

You must place global resources in the assets directory. If you have placed
your resources in the static directory, and you are unable or unwilling to move
them, you must mount the static directory to the assets directory by including
both of these entries in your site configuration:

  [[module.mounts]]
  source = 'assets'
  target = 'assets'

  [[module.mounts]]
  source = 'static'
  target = 'assets'

The CSV file must have a header row.

@context {page} page A reference to the page with the page resource, or the current page.
@context {string} path The path to the CSV file.
@context {string} [delimiter=","] The delimiting character between the fields in each row.

@returns {object}

@example {{ $data := partial "csv-to-map.html" (dict "page" . "path" "pets.csv") }}
