I got the idea to make a Garmin watch face from [a Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/9ndo8o/oc_always_keep_some_terminal_with_you/) for the Samsung Gear that displayed some information in a terminal like way.

After installing Eclipse - a piece of software that very much does not feel at home on the Mac - I got to task. So far there hasn't been much real programming, just laying stuff out with XML and writing a rather monolithic `onUpdate` function in my `TerminalFaceView.mc` controller.

I haven't loaded it onto my __FÄ“nix 6 Pro__ yet, but in the simulator it looks like this!
