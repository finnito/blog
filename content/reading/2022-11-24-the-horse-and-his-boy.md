It took me a while to read this book because I got distracted, but, it was quite lovely. Following the trend set so far the writing is very simple and the narrator's point of view a bit odd at times.

His writing of the battle is much like J. R. R. Tolkien where Bilbo gets knocked out and the battle is summarised to him afterwards. This is much preferable to reading a blow-by-blow.

I'm about to engage on a sidequest to read Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir, but I'll be back to finish this series soon.
