Iâ€™m thoroughly enjoying this series so far! This story really held me - I didn't even quite figure it out right until near the end. Well played! It holds up amazingly well for being written in 1952.

I am also really enjoying that they are short, bite-sized books. Much easier to get through than some brick sized sci-fi epics. It must be due to their [being originally published as a series of short stories in a magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_and_Empire).

I'm looking forward to more! ðŸš€
