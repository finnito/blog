This book came to me as a recommendation from a friend and what a worthy recommendation it was. This book is equal parts horrifying fascinating. It engages you from start to finish and delivers an amazing level of detail.

We teach about microbes and diseases in Year 11 at High School here, so this is incredibly relevant. I want to assign the first chapter as required reading, because the description of the disease and its impacts is intense.

I can't recommend this book enough.
