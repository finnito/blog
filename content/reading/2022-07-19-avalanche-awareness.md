An excellent and detailed look into avalanches, terrain, weather and snowpack with a focus on New Zealand conditions. There's more than you could ever take in during a single read, so this book will be coming with me on any wintry or snowy tramp so I can keep my knowledge fresh.

I have an abiding love of the outdoors, be it running, tramping, skiing or rock climbing. As I get more experienced and fit I find myself wanting to be out during the cold months so the knowledge in this book is invaluable. In the near future I will likely take an avalanche/backcountry/alpine course and invest in a probe and transceiver, so itâ€™s good to do some pre-learning.

A must-read for any New Zealand outdoors-person.
