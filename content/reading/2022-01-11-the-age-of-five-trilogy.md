Heading into 2022 I thought I might try change up my reading by alternating between fiction and non-fiction. So here goes!

I had vague recollections of reading this series in my teens but couldn't quite remember. So, I got it out from the library and blasted through it! It is easy but fun reading. The magic in this universe in a bit different which I always enjoy. Because I had some ideas in my from last time, I was hanging on every word trying to figure it out!

All in all, a fun read! All I've got left to read by Trudi is The Traitor Spy Trilogy.
