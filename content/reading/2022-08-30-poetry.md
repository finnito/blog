After feeling a little burned out on science fiction with the Dune series, I turned to some classic poetry courtesy of [Standard eBooks](https://standardebooks.org).

I still feel I donâ€™t really get poetry, but Eliot has good variety in this collection. So far I liked:
- La Figlia Che Piange for its flow and feel,
- Sweeney Erect for its shape
- The Hollow Men
