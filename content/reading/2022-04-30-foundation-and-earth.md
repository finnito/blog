This was a great end to the Foundation series. While still quite sci-fantasy, there was a lot of discussion of the human condition and some gentle philosophy.

Overall I enjoyed this series and have put [the prequels and associated series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov#Science_fiction_2) on my to-read list.
