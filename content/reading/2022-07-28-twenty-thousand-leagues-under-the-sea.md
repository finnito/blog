This book is remarkably predictive and interesting. That said, Verne _loves_ a fish -- perhaps too much. Some sections are dragged out by his extensive description and scientific naming of marine fauna and flora. I'm sure it was appropriately impressive in 1872, though! I did find myself wanting to know how it would end, and was encouraged to read the final chapters after losing some interest.
