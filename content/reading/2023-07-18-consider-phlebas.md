This science fiction series has been on my radar for a really long time, so I was quite excited to start it. Each book seems to be quite distinct from the others, carrying no particular storyline (from what I can tell).

The scale of the universe, the technology involved and the minds are all super fascinating and I was drawn in immediately. I often find myself very interested to find out more about how a given universe works and often get very sucked in. I think I'll find myself committed to this who series!
