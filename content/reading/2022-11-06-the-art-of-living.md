I listened to this over a weekend with a few hours to myself and found it very interesting. Buddhism makes for some insightful spirituality teaching without the need for a deity. To me it seems to centre around connectedness, a lack of individual self, and transformation instead of beginnings and endings. I find this way of thinking quite compatible with Science and the needs of our modern world.

The thing I enjoy most in these teachings is that nothing, not even the word of the Buddha should be taken on _faith_. You should investigate everything critically and see if it fits with the universe as you see it. This leaves open the door for an ever-changing, improving and iterating worldview, vision of spirituality and way of living.

Hanh does a great job of communicating all of this and more in this compact and easily digestible book. As an audiobook I found it like a very approachable lecture - it translated into this medium very well.

Highly recommended.
