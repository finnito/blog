Well, this book is an experience. Grover's writing style is over the top, repetitive and honestly a bit manic sounding. But, there are some advice gems in there.

> Do. The. Work. Every day, you have to do something you donâ€™t want to do. Every day. Challenge yourself to be uncomfortable, push past the apathy and laziness and fear.

I think the chapter on accepting your dark side and working with it was particularly controversial, especially when he says he wishes Tiger Woods hadn't apologised for his behaviour. Questionable at best.

I also found the cooler, closer or cleaner metaphor clunky, forced, and honestly confusing.

Worth a read if you want some light entertainment with _some_ good advice sprinkled in among the chapters all given the number "#1", otherwise, give it a miss.
