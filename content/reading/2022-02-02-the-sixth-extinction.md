Despite having a physics and astronomy degree, biology, ecology and evolution are perhaps my favourite of the sciences. For that reason, I love reading about biology. Elizabeth has done an excellent job of making the story of extinctions, past and present, interesting and easy to read.

I recommend this book extremely highly for anyone wanting to continue learning about the field. It is also a very sobering look into the influence of Homo sapiens on Earth.
