As a teacher in New Zealand you are continuously prompted and nagged into learning [Te Reo M캐ori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language), [Tikanga M캐ori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikanga_M%C4%81ori) and about [Te Ao M캐ori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_culture). Unfortunately, the Ministry of Education is all talk and no action. They want these things but do not provide much (any) time for teachers to learn this. So it becomes something that you do in your own time.

In late 2022 I managed to secure a spot for an online course called [Papa Reo - NZ Certificate in Te Reo, offered by Te W캐nanga o Aotearoa](https://www.twoa.ac.nz/nga-akoranga-our-programmes/study-from-home/nz-certificate-in-te-reo). It's a year-long commitment and looks like it will be quite a bit of work. But, I am really pleased to be making a good start on my language learning journey. As part of that I felt the need to learn more about Te Ao M캐ori and Tikanga M캐ori. I often browse for books on these topics and I found this one, which was quite the tome and covered many topics.

I [got it out from the library](https://christchurch.wheelers.co/title/9781775589327/epub) and read it on my Kobo while doing the Hollyford-Pyke packrafting trip over New Years, which was really great. I found that it covered a really wide number of topics so was good to get insight into many areas. I do think that I will pick up a paper copy at some point so that I can reference it more easily.

I strongly recommend it!
