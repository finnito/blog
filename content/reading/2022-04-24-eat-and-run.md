This book was very easy to read, well told and very inspiring. It is part autobiography, part training advice, part cookbook and part story of how to live a meaningful life.

That said, Jurek comes across as very condescending and it's a bit simplistic. But he has had some big achievements so it's perhaps a bit expected.

I am looking forward to digging through the recipes and making some of the choice ones for my own running adventures. Iâ€™m always looking for good food to eat while on the move.

The last part of the book felt particularly relevant to someone who is going through a bit of a low point in their own training and racing (not that I ever win anything). It has helped me think about how to find the fun again, something I am currently doing â€” writing this from a tent on a riverbank part way through a packrafting and tramping trip with my partner. Weâ€™re hiding out the rain - itâ€™s due to clear tomorrow!

I would thoroughly recommend this book to any athletes, be they aspiring or currently succeeding at their life goals.
