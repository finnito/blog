In my teenage years I read all of Feist's books in the Midkemia universe and I loved them. I'm now 28 and my point of view is a little different but I still enjoyed this book.

It has a lot of _coming of age_ themes for young men. This was less interesting to me at the moment but I still liked it. The magic was also very different to that of Midkemia which was interesting - I do love some good magic!

Despite feeling unclear about the book to begin with, I'm very much looking forward to continuing this saga!
