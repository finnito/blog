Continuing my reading of the Foundation series, I also enjoyed this book. It has, as do many late-in-the-series sci-fi books, taken quite the turn from sci-fi into what feels more like fantasy. Perhaps the sci-fi-ness will be returned in the 5th book!

I mostly enjoyed the deeper look into the Second Foundation and that the book did not resolve quite as you expect. Leaves the door wide open for the next book and some further excitement!

I'm looking forward to the next one ðŸš€
