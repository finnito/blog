I reccently read The Best of Best New Zealand Poems and enojyed myself but felt that I didn't really understand most of the poetry. I didn't understand why it might have been written the way it was in order to evoke feelings and imagery. Thankfully I found this book soon after - and it's even written by a Kiwi which is always nice. It means that there will be a showcasing of New Zealand poets and poetry.

Early in the book I found myself enjoying Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Frosty Evening" and Keats “Ode to a Nightingale”. 

> Enjambment: the running over of a sentence from one verse or couplet into another so that closely related words fall in different lines

I wasn’t previously familiar with this word, but you see many enjambments in poetry so I was happy to have Jackson mention it. An example can be seen here in “Kubla Kahn” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

> … Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
>
> Through caverns measureless to man

I also appreciate the mention of various line structures:

- iambic pentameter
- iambic tetrameter
