After being wildly confused during [Dune Messiah](/reading/2022-01-19-dune-messiah/) I found this book easier to follow and understand. It was much more enjoyable and I felt that the plot pulled me along a lot more. I found myself looking for chances to continue reading and to find out what happens next.

It was really fun to learn a bit more about Dune and it had a pretty wild ending. I'm looking forward to God Emperor of Dune!
