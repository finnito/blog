Again, Zahn knocks it out of the park. I enjoyed the ending to this one â€“ rather satifying. Lots of little twists and turns to keep you guessing. Some of them a little obvious, but good. I guessed entirely wrong about Delta Source, which was satisfying. Always fun to have the author lead you in the wrong direction a little bit before getting you with the truth!

After finishing the trilogy I found myself immediately looking for more, only to find the audiobooks all out on loan at the library. Another time..
