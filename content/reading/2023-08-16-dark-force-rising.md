I continued to love the series with this installation. Having not read or watched much Star Wars outside of the main movies, I really enjoyed the continued building of the Star Wars universe. It's a shame to me that it became de-cannonised because there's some great stuff in here. They continue to have me going about Delta Source â€“ I've got a theory but who knows. Love it.

Next!
