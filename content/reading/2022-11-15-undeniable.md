Given that this book is both written and read by Bill Nye, it has all the usual humor and energy that you would expect from the absolute [meme lord](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Meme%20Lord) that is Bill. The energy takes you along on a ride of evolution, the science behind it, while also managing to touch on many other favourites such as dinosaurs and space.

That said, if you come from a place of science education, you may not learn all that much from this book. It is intended, I think, to be a gentle introduction into evolution, rather than an in-depth read. Go in with the right expectations and you will be entertain and enlightened!

Bill has always been about popular science, and this book is no difference. If you want something more in-depth in the topic, then perhaps consider something like [The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16176.The_Red_Queen), which comes quite highly recommended.
