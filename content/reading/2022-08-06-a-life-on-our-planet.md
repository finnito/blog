Sir David Attenborough is a gift to the world. It is easy to read, well-written and inspires critical appraisal of your lifestyle and the state of Earth. The book starts by taking you through a brief history of his life while delving into how Earth has changed during his lifetime â€“ it makes for some confronting reading. The second half takes a more optimistic and problem-solving-focused view, but also maintains a realistic outlook on the issues at hand. A must-read for anyone concerned about the state of the world.
