In our world, so frequently divided, so frequently mined for profit and for individual gain, it can be hard to see how we will progress forwards. How can we improve our lot, with such big steps being taken backwards?

```
For there is always light,
If only we’re brave enough to see it,
If only we’re brave enough to be it.
```

We allow our politicians, our democracy, our laws and our society to be overrun by the wealthy. We need to take a stand for ourselves, for our future generations and for our families.

```
And the norms and notions of what “just is”
Isn’t always justice.
```

Do read this beautiful piece of poetry if you get the chance.
