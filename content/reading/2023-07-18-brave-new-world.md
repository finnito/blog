Well, that was not what I expected from a 1932 science fiction book! I found [the foreword by Margaret Atwood](https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2017/02/margaret-atwood-introduces-a-brand-new-world) very helpful in understanding some of the ideas in the book. The contrast between the dominant (Christian) value system of the 1930s and the "everybody belongs to everybody" freedom is very stark. The ease of the world in which "everybody is happy now", the individual is gone, and nothing costs enough is juxtaposed with a world where pain, suffering and hurt are what makes it mean something. Thank you for the book, Ashley! ðŸ§¡
