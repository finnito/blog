Jen and I listened to [an interview by Kim Hill of Phillips](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2018845473/hazel-phillips-the-joys-of-tramping-solo) about this book on our way home from Te Anau. We had just completed the Kepler, one of the Great Walks of New Zealand. It was perhaps our most adventurous trip yet, despite being a Great Walk. We completed it in midwinter and there was a good deal of new snow, and some heightened avalanche conditions. We had our bags full of food, warm clothes, safety gear and ‚Äúunknown unknowns‚Äù. Knowledge we didn‚Äôt know we lacked as Phillips describes it.

Phillips takes you on a whirlwind tour of New Zealand tramping, alpine climbing, history, risk, death, feminism and confidence. I think this is a really valuable read for anyone into the outdoors - it has a lot of lessons to teach if you are ready to receive them. It is also equally entertaining and makes for a good story, if that is what you are into!
