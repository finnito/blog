Iâ€™m trying not to re-read books this year, but I last read this in 2010 so... It was more chilling and tense than I remember! A completely horrifying world, and yet McCarthy carries you along from sentence to sentence and page to page until itâ€™s 12:30 am and the book is done.

There were many many details I didnâ€™t remember from my high school times, and lots of details that I understood more now I have some more worldly experience. This book is truly excellent. A required read, to be sure.
