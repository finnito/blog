After being recommended this book a _lot_ I ended up being gifted it for Christmas (thanks, Mum!). Turns out itâ€™s as great as everyone says it is. The science feels immersive and accurate and doesnâ€™t stray too far into science-fantasy, which I love.

During the reading I found out that I now think paper books are inferior. Theyâ€™re hard to hold while being comfortable in bed and get well illuminated. Kobo for the win.

The plot was original and interesting and you canâ€™t help but want to keep reading at the end of every chapter.

Loved it.
