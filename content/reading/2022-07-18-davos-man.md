A very good read into how billionaires have altered the governments of the world to benefit themselves to the deficit of the rest of us. It tells the stories of fabric designers in Italy to steel mills in the US and how our anger to the “others” who take our jobs is actually misplaced, and how our anger should be directed at the parasitic billionaires of the world. Read it. Be informed and exercise your democratic right to vote! It’s time to do away with billionaries and The Cosmic Lie.
