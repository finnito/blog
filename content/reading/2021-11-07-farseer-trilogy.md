I thoroughly enjoyed this book - I'm a big lover of the Fantasy genre, and this ticked all the boxes. I enjoyed how there was some magic, but it was more subtle than is some other series I love (looking at you, [Raymond E Feist](http://www.crydee.com/raymond-feist/book-series). The magic is not all-powerful and the world seems quite believable.

I also enjoyed the style of writing - how it was written as a recounting, almost a journal entry. I'd highly recommend this series, and I am looking forward to digging into more of [Robin's books!](http://www.robinhobb.com/works.htm)
