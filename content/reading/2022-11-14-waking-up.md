Whatever foibles you may believe Harris possesses, he is well learned and has a great depth of firsthand knowledge in the search of secular spirituality. This book is an informative dive into the mind and spirituality without needing to posit a deity (or many). I also appreciated that Harris looks briefly at pseudoscience and the problematic “gurus” who often peddle abusive behaviours in the name of “enlightenment”.

That said, Harris has a rather narrow definition of what spirituality might mean – mainly confining it to no individual self etc.. This could definitely leave you feeling like he possibly missed the bigger picture here.
