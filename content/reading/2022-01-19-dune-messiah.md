I was really excited to discover that Dune was merely the start of Frank Herbertâ€™s Dune universe - and this second book didnâ€™t disappoint!

After getting past the large time-jump, and the jump in the framing of the main character, the book flowed really well. It was a really interesting look into what can happen to a revered leader over a few years. Iâ€™m very much looking forward to reading some more of his books!
