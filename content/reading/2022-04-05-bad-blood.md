In the mid 2010s I heard about Theranos but didn't pay it much attention. I heard about it again during its downfall but again, didn't pay much attention. It wasn't until the founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud in 2022 that I really noticed what had been going on.

I searched for it online and saw this book recommended and immediately put it at the top of my reading list. It did not disappoint. John's reporting is unreal and the number of sources and access he got is unreal.

The book is a tour de force on how _not_ to run a company, on how _not_ to treat your employees, on how _not_ to revolutionise the medical industry, and on how _not_ to inspire the next generation of STEAM students and workers.

I highly recommend this for anyone working in and around the medical profession, but also just for anyone wanting a very interesting read.

TLDR: Yikes.
