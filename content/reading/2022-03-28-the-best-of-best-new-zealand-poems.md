I listen to some podcasts from RNZ, and [this one appeared in my feed a couple of weeks ago](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/2018833107/new-zealand-men-s-reading-rates-continuing-to-drop). It was on reading rates in New Zealand, and had some interesting stats about how much the different genders read different genres. What stuck in my mind was the idea of _reading poetry_. It wasn't really something I had considered!

I searched around for a book of New Zealand poetry that I could get online from the library and found this one. I was interested in the [Poetry New Zealand Yearbook 2021](https://www.masseypress.ac.nz/books/poetry-new-zealand-yearbook-2021) but the library didn't seem to have it.

I enjoyed the read, although I‚Äôm fairly certain I missed the point of many (most) of the poems. Some were flowy, like poetry of high school, but others were stilted and I couldn‚Äôt grasp the story. I did find some of the longer ones interesting, though, where it seems more like a short story told in verse.

I particularly liked:

- X-Ray by Peter Bland
- Fitter Turner by Jenny Bornholdt
- University Open Day by James Brown
- Tidal by Alistair te Ariki Campbell
- Making Waves by Chris Orsman

Perhaps next time I‚Äôll understand more! üßê
