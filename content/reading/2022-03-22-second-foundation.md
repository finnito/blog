Iâ€™m still very much enjoying this series, and this one was no different. It was really interesting to get some insight into The Second Foundation, their motives and how they function. Still, though. Much is left unsaid and I canâ€™t wait for more!

I also watched the first episode of the TV series and very much enjoyed the spectacle and high quality sci-fi-ness of it all. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing how the rest of the season pans out. ðŸ¤ž
