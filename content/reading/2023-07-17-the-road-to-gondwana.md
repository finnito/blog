This year I had a major surgery â€“ open heart surgery for an aortic valve replacement! As I checked into the hospital for my operation and recovery a number of Jenâ€™s doctor friends came to visit me. I really appreciated their time. Amazingly, a couple of them bought me some books! I hardly even buy myself books these days.

This one was a gift from the ever-kind, Hayleigh. It took me forever to read because I found it quite hard to maintain concentration on reading post-surgery. I put it down to the energy needed for recovery and the general anaesthetic.

The book is well-written, interesting and very informative. It turns out I really like reading and learning about paleontology and paleobiology. Really fascinating stuff. I need more visuals to help visualise the animals, forests and plants being described, though! Pure words-to-brain imagery is perhaps not my forte.

The human element of the story around the scientific quest to understand geology, evolution, extinction, and related fields was also super interesting. I wasnâ€™t aware that Robert Falcoln Scott was interested in science and that his expedition had a scientific element to it. I had presumed it was all adventure!

Highly recommended.
