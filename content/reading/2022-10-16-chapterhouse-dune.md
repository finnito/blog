What a book! Amazing. It was great to stick with the storyline set up in Heretics of Dune and to see a conclusion eventuate. There were lots of unfinished threads and one can see how there is room for much more writing to come.

I didn't quite click on the final plan until it occurred, which was quite fun. I always enjoy when it sneaks up on you like that! Excellent writing.

With Herbert's death after this book, it appears the series was taken up by Brian Herbert (his son) and Kevin J Anderson. I know Anderson's writing from [The Saga of Seven Suns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_J._Anderson_bibliography#The_Saga_of_Seven_Suns_series), which I thoroughly enjoyed, so I'm willing to give them a try!

That said, the extended universe of writings is well, [extensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)), and a bit intimidating. I'll have to intersperse it with other books or I'll get completely bogged down.

All I can say is that I loved the series so far and that you most definitely need to read it!
