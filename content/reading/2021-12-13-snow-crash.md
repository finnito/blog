This book feels fast-paced and is full of bizarre future-lingo. The way it is written and all the new concepts keep you hanging on every word -- trying to put it together and figure it all out.

The world is familiar but completely and utterly dystopian. It's unclear what year it is, but that doesn't seem to matter - it is some time in the future and it has all fallen apart!

Strong recommendation!
