This is an excellent retelling of a set of speeches given by Thunberg. She is direct, too the point, and honest. It is truly refreshing.

> “I have Asperger's syndrome, and to me, almost everything is black or white.
I think in many ways that we autistic are the normal ones and the rest of the people are pretty strange. They keep saying that climate change is an existential threat and the most important issue of all. And yet they just carry on like before. If the emissions have to stop then we must stop the emissions. To me, that is black or white. There are no grey areas when it comes to survival. Either we go on as a civilization or we don’t. We have to change.” - Greta Thunberg

The audiobook is just over an hour long and 100% worth a listen.
