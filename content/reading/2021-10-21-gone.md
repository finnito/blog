I read this book while on a [9-day tramp around Stewart Island](1), doing nothing more than enjoying the nature, taking photos, eating food and reading. It was really very delightful - and all the while I had this very excellent book to keep me thinking about Ecology and the impact of humankind on the world around us.

The way Michael tells the story of each animal is very engaging and easy to read. He pulls you along, each story, conversation and trip linking back to the animal at hand.

I will be trying to assign some the chapters as readings for the Science, Physics and Earth and Space classes I teach!
