Foundation has been on my radar for a very long time, and after seeing it mentioned online more frequently since the Apple TV series was released, I finally jumped in!

The book was amazingly easy to read, in part due to Asimov's writing style, and in part due to the fact that the book is a series of short stories compiled together. It's quite amazing to see what Asimov dreamed of back in the 1940s, long before much of this technology was even close to possible.

I loved it and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series! ðŸš€
