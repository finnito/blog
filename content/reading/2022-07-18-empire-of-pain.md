From start to finish this expertly researched book details the moral corruption and emotional detachment of the entire Sackler family. Not a single person displays any understanding of how their business or their actions have harmed millions of people worldwide.

How they are able to suspend their understanding of reality and deny any wrongdoing is equal parts disturbing and amazing. Also amazing is how they appear to be the origin of many shady practices that pharmaceutical companies employ. I can recommend reading [Bad Pharma](/reading/2022-01-08-bad-Pharma) by Ben Goldacre to see these practices in their most modern and malevolent forms.

Upsettingly, the family mostly got away with it (currently), but one can only hope that the law will catch up with them and that their bloodied-billions will be taken to help those who have suffered, and are currently suffering.

Strong recommend.
