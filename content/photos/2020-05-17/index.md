This view of Lyttelton Harbour is one of my favourites from the Port Hills. It's on the [Breeze Bay Walking Track](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/godley-head/things-to-do/godley-head-loop-track/) on the south side of Godley Heads. Best experienced on a relaxed Sunday run!
