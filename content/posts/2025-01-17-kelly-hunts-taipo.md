## Day 1: To Carroll Hut

We set off in the afternoon knowing that the hike to Carroll Hut was relatively short and that we would be able to do it reasonably quickly. It was humid and steep, but we were stoked to knock it out in about ~1:30. On our last trip in the area ([Newton - Three Passes](/posts/newton-three-passes/)) we really enjoyed all of the red on the hillsides from the Southern Rata, and we were stoked to see they were still in bloom. Just stunning.

The track climbs unrelentingly through the bush and only relaxes a little bit once you reach the treeline. From there it sidles and climbs towards the hut while putting the most stunning views on offer. You can see Otira and the viaduct. Super cool!

There was only one other person at the hut which was nice. We had a lovely dinner (thanks, Jen!) that included fresh veges and flatbreads from home and then climbed into bed. Just after 11pm a family came into the hut and we found out in the morning that there was kea attacking their tents into the night and that they decided to call it quits and come inside. It was also raining a little bit, so it was probably a good call all around.

> 🍫 A hot chocolate and some actual chocolate.

## Day 2: To Hunts Hut

We weren't in any major hurry to leave today with [Remote Huts](https://www.remotehuts.co.nz/hunts-creek-hut.html) describing the route via the Kelly Range as taking 4-5 hours. We took it slow and enjoyed the scenery – especially the view up the valley containing Hunts Creek. Just spectacular! We started by following the track that eventually descends to Seven Mile Creek but turned off at the tarns and veered towards Pt. 1411. From there it was a straightforward amble along the tops past Pt. 1313 and then descending to the two tarns. We didn't find the descent to the tarns very easy to follow – the route is not obvious and the low scrub becomes quite dense and hard to navigate. After the tarns, the route climbs back up the ridge for ~20m before the route down to the marsh reveals itself. We were pleased that it hadn't rained much in recent days and that the marsh was relatively easy to traverse. It would be a _very_ muddy affair otherwise!

From the marsh the route descends alongside (and sometimes in) a small creek before intersecting with the DOC maintained track to Hunt Saddle and Hunts Creek Hut. Once on the track navigation is much more straightforward, however, we found the track is a bit overgrown and very up-and-down. The Topo50 map seems to imply a track that more or less follows a contour, but that is very much not the case. It drops steep in and out of creeks, and climbs/descends steeply rather frequently. In the heat of the afternoon we battled with this section of track, but it meant that the afternoon spent in the hut was quite delightful.

## Day 3: To Mid-Taipo Hut via Dry Creek

We had the hut to ourselves overnight – something that feels more and more like a rare occurance. Feeling well rested, also owing to the many hours spent lazing in the hut the previous day, we headed off for a bit of an unknown crossing into the Taipo via Dry Creek. There is mention made of it on Remote Huts but I couldn't find any description of how long it might take, other than a group that took 8 hours to ascend Dry Creek from the Taipo side. It was also mentioned a bunch in the hut book, but no timings. Still, the sun was out, we felt good, and there was some great backcountry travel ahead of us!
