Yesterday Jen and I finished the [Hollyford-Pyke packraft](/posts/hollyford-pyke-packraft/) and camped on Milford Rd. We had one day left before having to drive home, so we hit up Gertrude Saddle and [Lake Marian](/posts/lake-marian/).

DOC gives a 4-6hrs trip time, so we got there relatively early and did our best to boost along the flat valley. The sun was out and it was very hot again. Perfect.

After about 2.2km you get into the steep section of the hike. It turns to pretty loose rock among tussocks until about 3.4km where you transition onto the slabs. The slabs can be slippery (as warned many times by DOC) in wet weather/snow. Thankfully we had perfect weather and conditions, so continued to power up. We reached Black Lake at 60min and the saddle at 1:19hrs.

The view from the top is immense. It's truly amazing. We headed up a little further to the northwest to get a wider view of the valley. Worth the scramble! We meandered around for a while before heading down. We made pretty quick time over the rather grippy rocks.

__Overall:__ totally worth the trip; not that scary; not that dangerous in good conditions.
