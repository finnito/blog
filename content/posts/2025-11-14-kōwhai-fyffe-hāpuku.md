## Day 1: To Kōwhai Hut

To make this trip work as a complete loop we decided to drop bikes at the Hāpuku road end (locked to a fence, hidden in some bushes) and drive to the Kōwhai road end. Despite managing to get four bikes on the car rack for the [Alps2Ocean](/posts/alps2ocean/), we couldn't quite manage it this time around. In the end, we took off one of Jen's pedals and strapped her bike to the roof.

With what felt like the aerodynamic efficiency of a brick, we made our way to Kaikōura. By the time we stashed the bikes and got our backpacks sorted, the sun was blazing and we were glad to walk up the Kōwhai River for a few hours. [The river had come up](https://www.ecan.govt.nz/data/riverflow/sitedetails/63201) the previous couple of days (according to ECan), but had swiftly fallen back to a normal flow. Which is to say, the river-travel was straightforward and the river level provided no problems.

After about 6.6km (2hrs), Spainard Spur Track comes down from Mt Fyffe and you can follow a well-formed track on the true left of the Kōwhai River all the way to Kōwhai Hut. Only one river crossing is left to do immediately below the hut!

We umed-and-ahed about bringing tents, but were very glad to have done so when we reached Kōwhai Hut! The beds were all full (but the hunters were out stalking some prey), and there was already two tents pitched. Three more were to come later in the evening.

Kelly, one of the hunters, had misplaced a jacket the previous weekend on the Hāpuku side of Kōwhai Saddle and was _very_ keen to tell us all about it so that we could find it. After getting some coordinates, we were confident we could find it!

## Day 2: To Hāpuku Hut

I woke to wind buffeting the tent in the night, and then again to rain in the morning. Thankfully, it was fairly minimal and wasn't to last. By the time I crawled out of bed, it had cleared. On the other hand, Claire and Michael had got up when it started and packed their tent, just in case it got really bad!

We trundled back down the track the way we came yesterday in order to take Spainard Spur Track to My Fyffe Hut. We soon warmed up as we got into the sun, and were quickly sweating as we climbed steeply up to Mt Fyffe Hut.

> __1hr 40min__ to Mt Fyffe Hut<br/>
> __1hr 15min__ to Mt Fyffe summit

This route choice looks rather odd on the map, but Claire and Michael hadn't been to Fyffe summit, nor over Gable's End, so we thought we might as well have a big day and tick them all off!

From Fyffe summit (where we lunched), the track follows the ridge with only a couple of short climbs to contend with. It also gives you the first taste of the scree slope that will take you from Gable's End to Kōwhai Saddle. Claire was a little unsure to begin with but much more confident by the end. Unfortunately, however, there was one casualty!After >1,000km of hiking, my right boot split open.

We took a short rest just above Kōwhai Saddle before turning off to Hāpuku River. We soon found Kelly's jacket on the side of the track where its camouflage had done a great job at blending in to the leaf litter.

At the hut we met two hunters who told us their dog had run off into the bush the day before. They didn't seem so concerned but asked if we could call out for her on the way down to the car the next day. After they headed out for an evening hunt we attempted to chop some wood for the fire, but the axe was possibly the bluntest we've ever seen, and the saw wasn't much better. Still, it was enough to take the chill off, and then to completely overdo it and make it _too_ warm. Whoops!

## Day 3: Out via Hāpuku River

After getting back to the hut very late, the hunters also got up quite early to go for another stalk before heading out. We rolled out of bed not too long after them, but were in much less of a hurry to get out. We had heard that taking the river to the Hāpuku road end was a good deal slower than the track, despite the slip
