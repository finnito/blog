__Runners__ Finn and Jen

We went away over New Years with a bunch of Jens doctor friends and on our way down to Tekapo we wanted to stop and do something sporty. I originally planned for us to hike into this hut for the night but we didn't have the time in the end. No worries though, this hut is excellent as a trail run and might have been too small for an overnight hike!

The start of the track can be found down the access road to [Fox Peak Ski Field](https://www.foxpeak.co.nz/). The road is closed at the North Opuha River out of ski season and it is private access. This is __not__ noted [on the DOC website](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/canterbury/places/te-kahui-kaupeka-conservation-park/things-to-do/huts/spurs-hut/), but you should call ahead and leave a message if no one picks up.

> __DOC__: 7km to the hut. Walking, mountain biking and horse treking allowed. Please keep to 10m easement. Close the gates. No public access to Fox Peak Ski Field.

> __Lillydale Farm__: Private property. __Permission must be gained to enter. Contact Warrick Day at w.wday.@xtra.co.nz or [03 249 8025](tel:032498025).__

It was quite a humid day and neither of us had done much high intensity exercise in a couple of weeks so we were feeling a bit out of practice. That feeling only intensified when we started running - we both felt pretty terrible despite the gentle (if muddy) gradient.

There were some little creeks to splash our feet in which was nice, and there was a couple of climbs as you enter DOC land on the North Opuha Track near Spurs Hut. The hut itself is located at the bottom of a spur (funny that) in a rather marshy area. For that reason it is propped up off the ground to keep it dry, and it has a little porch which you could conceivably put a small tent on if needed.

Overall, it is a beautiful area that deserves for some future exploring!
