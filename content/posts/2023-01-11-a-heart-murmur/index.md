## Discovery: I've Got a Murmur!

In 2019 I found myself with a new partner -- Jen. She's pretty rad, if I do say so myself. She is also a doctor, which leads to many interesting conversations that I love. One evening we were having a bit of a snuggle (cute, I know), and she goes "You have a heart murmur!". I didn't know what to make of that and she told me to see "a real doctor", but I was probably just tachycardic[^1]. We both promptly forgot about it.

Fast forward to 2022 and I'm seeing my GP for an unrelated issue and he asks "Can I listen to your heart?". So, he puts his stethoscope in his ears and what do you know "You've got a heart murmur". "Oh yeah! My partner picked that up in 2019 but we both forgot about it." Well, he wanted to investigate it. He refered me to the DHB and a few months later and I got an appointment for an echocardiogram[^2].

## My Malformed Aortic Valve

My echo was performed by a lovely technician who let me ask lots of questions. I was mostly interested in the doppler shift[^3] I could see on the ultrasound screen -- very interesting stuff! Turns out, it shows the flow of blood. Super cool. She told me that yep, thats definitely a "bicuspid aortic valve" and there's definitely "regurgitation" and a "leaflet looks stenosed". To explain:

- the aortic valve should have three leaflets not two[^4],
- stenosed means that the leaflet is not as flexible as it should be and doesn't open/close properly[^5],
- and regurgitation means that some blood is flowing back into the left ventrical due to the malformed leaflets[^6].

In summary, not good.

## My Sad Aorta

Later that day I got a call from a very kind cardiologist who explained these things in more detail and also noted that my aorta is dilatated[^7].

> __Dilated__: make or become wider, larger, or more open
> 
> __Dilatated__: make or become wider, larger or more open through active or artificial means, usually beyond natrural sizes.

Hmm, what can cause that? In my case, a bicuspid aortic valve. Is it bad? Yes. How bad? Very, if its gets to the point where the aorta dissects.

> __Aortic dissection__: where the inner layer of the aorta sustains a tear which fills with blood and can cause the aorta to split open (potentially fatal).[^8]

## So, What's the Fix? 

To stop the aorta dilatating any further, pressure needs to be reduced. This can be done by replacing the aortic valve to get new leaflets. To do this you need to undergo open heart surgery and be put on a bypass machine.[^9] Pretty serious stuff.

The dilatation of my aorta is such that it should be repaired. This reduces the risk of fatal dissection. The repair can be affected with a Dacron graft to replace the section of dilatated aorta.[^10] Intense!

After this, my left ventrical, which is also dilatated, should _hopefully_ return to normal size. This _should_ occur because it will not have to accommodate the regurgitated blood.[^11]

## What Now?

I've had my echo and an appointment with my cardiologist. Now, my case will be presented to the _entire_ set of cardiothorassic surgons at Christchurch Public Hospital. At the meeting they will agree on the most appropriate surgical fix. After that, I get an appointment with my surgon to discuss their recommendations and we go from there..
