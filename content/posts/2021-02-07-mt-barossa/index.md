This was my second time up Mt Barrossa in a few months. The first time I went with Jen and Tessa and we took Lexi 🐕, and this time Jen was at work and we had since recused a dog (!!) so I took Korra 🐕.

It was, both times, blisteringly hot and we sweated up a storm. The track starts gently - it's a trick though! About 1km in it starts to climb up a ridgeline and it doesn't really stop until it gets to the top. It's not unmanagably steep at all though.

Korra didn't vibe with the stream at the bottom and tried to jump it - she failed. We also jogged part of the way down in an effort to get Korra out of the sun a little sooner. She had a real good lie down in the shade of the car at the end. Oh, there's not a single piece of shade on the whole route.

A great walk, although it's a bit far from Chrsitchurch for such a short daywalk though! Might be nicer if you were staying in the area and were doing a fiew different trips.
