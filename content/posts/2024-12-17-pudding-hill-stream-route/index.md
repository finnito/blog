I never knew this route existed until I saw it on the [Hiking With Dogs New Zealand](https://www.facebook.com/groups/154837325051382) Facebook page and [Tim H](/people/#tim-h) did it as a Coast to Coast training run. When Dad asked if I wanted to go for a day trip and bring [Korra](/people/#korra-), this came to mind! It turned out to be a hidden gem within a short drive from Christchurch which makes for a great day trip.

We headed first up to Scotts Saddle Track: it climbs steeply at times through bush and exposed tussock. But, it is all very manageable at a walk. Running would be a good deal harder! The forest is super nice and full of natives. It's damp and dense at the bottom, and more beech-y the closer you get to the treeline. Once you reach Scotts Saddle, you walk up the Mt Hutt access road for a couple hundred metres before entering the bush on Pudding Hill Stream Route and descending steeply toward Pudding Hill Stream.

The travel downstream is all very accessible, with the river not deep or fast enough (at normal flows) to impede crossings or travel. That said, always check [the river gauge on Environment Canterbury](https://www.ecan.govt.nz/data/riverflow//sitedetails/68836) and a [nearby rain gauge](https://www.ecan.govt.nz/data/rainfall-data//sitedetails/315510) to see what the river is doing. It was around 0.8 cumec during our trip.

The last section, Alder Track, is wide and well-formed and makes for easy travel back to the carpark. Overall, this is a great dog-friendly day trip and I'm sure I'll be back to do it again!
