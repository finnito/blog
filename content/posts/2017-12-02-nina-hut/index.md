__Hikers__: Finn, Seonaid and Jay

This trip is from the what feels like the depths of time. In search of some good day hikes we ended up in Lewis Pass. Overall we felt like we spent too long driving for the length of the hike, but ah well, it's a very nice track!

The track starts nearby Palmer Lodge and it is rather obscured on the West side of the road. There is sometimes a homemade wood sign to show you the way because the DOC one is not the most visible. The track starts by crossing the Lewis River on a great wee bridge before climbing gently around the corner of the Nina Valley. The ground through here is very marshy and boggy so take care - it does get better!

The track crosses Nina River on another great bridge - make sure you look down! The river around the bridge makes a great swimming hole if you can stand the sandflies!

From there the track climbs reasonably gently along the true right of the river to the hut. It can be quite wet through here but the track was quite well formed at the time of this hike. There was a little bit of tree fall but not too bad.

The hut was really nice and has a great outlook up the valley and the surrounding mountains. I'd love to go back as part of a longer tramp - perhaps to Devils Den Bivs and the Sylvia Tops.
