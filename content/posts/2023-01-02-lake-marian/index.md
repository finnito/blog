Yesterday Jen and I finished the [Hollyford-Pyke packraft](/posts/hollyford-pyke-packraft/) and this morning we went up [Gertrude Saddle](/posts/gertrude-saddle/). We were due to drive up to Cromwell that afternoon/evening but had just enough time to sneak in a trip to Lake Marian if we walked fast/jogged.

We parked on the Lower Hollyford Road with what seemed like the rest of New Zealand and got on the track at a light jog. It starts off pretty easy before it takes a turn away from the river and onto the true right of Marian Creek. Here the track becomes much steeper, rootier and boggy. The heat of the day was setting in now and our pace slowed a lot.

We made good time to the lake (about 45min) at which point Jen didn't stop running and went basically straight in for a swim. It was pretty cold but extremely refreshing after the hot, sweaty work of the run/power hike. We had a great time in the water and even bumped into our stranger friend from Gertrude Saddle and his dad.

Unfortunately we couldn't stay too long so we headed back down in our wet clothes. They did a lot to keep us cool(er) on the descent. Much appreciated. We had a lot of fun dodging roots and trees on the way down; doing our best to imitate mountain goats üêê.

__Overall:__ This walk is well worth is, especially if it's hot weather and you can go for a swim! Not to be missed.
