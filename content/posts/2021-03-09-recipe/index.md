## The Chili

### Ingredients
- 1.5 tablespoons oil
- 1 medium-large kumara peeled and diced
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons chilli powder
- 4 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2.5 cups water
- 2x 400g cans black beans (liquid included)
- 1 400g can diced tomatoes
- 4 teaspoons lime juice
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

### Instructions

1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add sweet potato and onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion is beginning to soften, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, chilli powder, cumin, chipotle and salt and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds. Add water and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the sweet potato is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.

2. Add beans, tomatoes and lime juice; increase heat to high and return to a simmer, stirring often. Reduce heat and simmer until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro.
