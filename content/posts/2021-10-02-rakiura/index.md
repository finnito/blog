## Day 0: Fly to Mason Bay

> E koekoe te tūī, e ketekete te kākā, e kūkū te kererū
> _the tūī sqwaks, the kākā chatters, the kererū coos_.

Our tramping group is made of very different people who look at tramping rather differently and have quite different types of people. It takes all sorts of people to have a good trip; to keep it in balance and find a good middle ground. Some diplomacy will be required but it will be good!

Today Jen, Neil and I flew to Invercargill around 9am, and were joined by Francie, Justin and Henri around midday. We took an afternoon flight to Mason Bay which involved landing on the beach near Martin’s Creek, before swapping pilots and doing a quick hop up the beach to Duck Creek. From there it was a ~15min walk to Mason Bay Hut with one minor creek crossing five minutes before the hut. I recommend taking your boots off and going barefoot the rest of the way - it’s all just grass from there.

We had a lot of debate about the next day to Big Hellfire Hut as there is a tidally affected zone, but the high tide track is steep, poorly marked and most likely involves bush bashing. We have agreed to leave mid-morning and arrive at the zone an hour or so after high tide and see if we can pass.

### Searching for Kiwi 🥝

We’re all quite determined to see a kiwi on this trip, after not seeing any last time we were here (over 10 years ago)! A whiteboard reports that the best time to see kiwi is either 6.30-7.30am or 9.00-9.30pm, while a DOC poster says only 30% of visitors see kiwi.

A nighttime walk up to the homestead did not result in any kiwi sightings, but we did see two very cute deer right outside the hut!

## Day 1: To Big Hellfire Hut

> Kia mate ururoa, kei mate wheke.
> Fight like a shark, don’t give up like an octopus.

All good to do the high tide track.
Quite the slog up to Pt. 399. A good day. Don’t expect to go fast. Nothing prepares you for the mud. Mollymorks on the beach.
Toilet available at Little Hellfire Beach campground. Look out for the catprints. Cool use of buoys for track markers.

Left at 9.45am after nice breakfast. Reached bluff at 10.45 but still too high to pass. High tide route.

## Day 2: To East Ruggedy Hut

> Tama tū, tama ora; tama noho, tama mate.
> He who stands, lives; he who does nothing, perishes.

- Nice lunch spot in the sun just before West Ruggedy Beach in the trees. 
- Lookout was beautiful - highlight of the day.
- Neil got first known descent on crotch-deep mud puddle.
- Didn’t have to use the high tide route on West Ruggedy Beach.
- Lovely afternoon sun at the hut. Used solar panel to charge phone briefly.
- Overall the day felt easier than day 1. There was a little less height gain and sections of track that were drier and less muddy.

## Day 3: To Long Harry Hut

> Tini whetū ki te rangi, he iti te pōkēao ka ngaro.
> A small cloud overhead will obscure the stars.

The climbing today was mostly easier and the track condition was much better. There were LOTS of sandflies at the beaches which made stopping there unbearable.

The first beach under point 360 is very bouldery - so keep your eye on loose stones to keep your ankles intact. 
The second beach (Long Harry Bay) is not very accessible from the track as it is mostly cliffs. We lunched above the beach in the trees though, and I think I spied a way down through some tussocks.

The last climbs and traverse from Long Harry Bay is HARD work with lots more up and down than is obvious from the topo map. The sun had come out at this point (yay) so we were sweating hard.

The hut is beautifully situated and there is cellphone reception from the mainland pretty much anywhere with a clear view over to Te Tiriti o te Moana. We swam at the rocky beach below Hut - thankful to have a rinse. The water was bracing.

Nick and Chaz went fishing and were very blessed with some kai Moana in the form of a couple large paua and blue cod. Neil also got a paua and we all enjoy the buttery and garlicy snack with dinner.

The weather was much nicer today and I was extremely grateful for that. The track was also generally much better condition and there was a lot less vertical meters to be climbed. All of this made for a much better day after having a small cloud over my head on day two.

I was pleased to read my book and to use my solar panel charger for the first time this trip - successfully charging both Jen and I’s watches over the afternoon. I still kind of want to sell mine and get the enduro though!

I saw my first roa in the bush near the hut on the final descent, although it didn’t get out on the track in front of us. Very cute. Heard sounds at night time but unfortunately also heard one possum and saw another in front of us on the track.

## Day 4: To Yankee River Hut

> 

- Great day. Easy start to the day climbing gently through the bush to Smoky Beach.
- Beautiful golden sandy bay, great for swimming on a beautiful day.
- Very direct climb up to ~280m but manageable and then descending into Yankee River Hut.
- When descending down the last sand dune out of Smoky Beach, don’t cross the stream. Turn right instead up the hill.
- No where near as muddy as Mason Bay or Hellfire legs. Good track condition overall.
- Beautiful situ for a Hut, but it needs a bit of a clean! Some exit mould would go a long way. 
- Dad caught a fish - got some extra dinner. Might go out to look for paua at low tide.
- The inlet is great for a quick dip to wash boots, gaiters and ourselves.
- Cool swing Bridge.
- Battery pack died I think but solar panel is doing well with the watches. Bit slow to charge the phone though.
- Went hunting for paua- took a couple of hours but got two right at the end. Cut my finger pretty good but they smell delicious!

## Day 5: To Christmas Village Hut

> Ehara! Ko koe te ringa e huti punga!
> Yes! Yours is the arm best suited to pull up the anchor.

- GroundEffect selling ultralight sleeping bag ?fastpacking
- ? sponsor a CHS C2C team
- ? Ironman 71.3
- Improve breakfast efficiency: muesli, jetboil, coffee in thermas
- Tried fishing but the sea was too rough at high tide.
- Not many limpets available at high tide. Lost a hook.
- Nice walk - good track and much less climbing which was very nice.

## Day 6: Hananui / Mt Anglem

> E tū te huru mā, haramai e noho. E tū te huru pango, hanatu e haere.
> Let the white hair remain here, let the black hair get up and go.

- Left at 8am to summit Hananui.
- Sunset came in the front window; completely beautiful and visible from bed!!
- Track to Hananui was pretty good all things considered. Got up in 2:20 and down quicker.
- Lack of firewood at the hut but Jen and I took a couple of logs from up Hananui back to the hut. We also scoured the beach for dry wood.
- Pondered my te reo māori ability on the walk. Would like to get better. ? Enroll at Te Wānanga; ? Summer course; ? Find all school waiata and practice; ? Practice with Amy
- Had a nice afternoon nap.
- ? National Geographic subscription
- Honeycomb Hill caves
- Ngarua caves near Takaka
- Awamoana moa bone excavations
- Saw a cute little grey bird at the top of Hananui and a seal in the ocean outside the hut. Everyone went outside to see it, and it was very curious as to all the people watching it.
- Heavy rain in the afternoon and loud waves. Nice for an afternoon nap with the fire on. 
- Hēnarae Hāmana - huia birdsong
- Ghosts of Gondwana - George Gibbs
- Remutaka Ranges’ Catchpool Track (huia country)

## Day 7: To Bungaree Hut

> E kitea ai ngā taonga o te moana, me mākū koe.
> If you seek the treasures of the ocean, you better get wet.

- Rain was forecast for the night and morning, so we started a little slow. It was misty and damp but we didn’t get wet really.
- Tried to leave the hut nice and clean
- Walk was gentle and nice in the forest
- Reached Murray Beach in good time, and decided to have lunch at the south end in the sun. Beautiful spot, but cold in the breeze.
- The rest of the track was alright, pretty up and down but nothing too long or strenuous.
- Brain not motivated today; pretty tired and just wanted to stop. Hungry. Looking forward to getting out.
- Bungaree Hut is beautiful and has a great outlook on the beach.
- Went for a nice swim to get clean - very cold but very worth it.
- sat in the sun and read my book with Jen. Lovely.
- Brainstormed writing a book as a guide through Y9-10 science curriculum
- The Sixth Extinction
- Research wide angle lens again
