Something I have recently gotten into is writing in [Markdown][md] - in fact, these very posts in my Guides addon are written in [Markdown][md]. It is very readable and great for publishing, but sometimes you want to go further and embed some more complex HTML elements inside it. Markdown natively allows you to do that, but I wanted to supercharge this so I got [Twig][tw] involved!

## The Error

```
Symfony \ Component \ Debug \ Exception \ FatalErrorException (E_UNKNOWN)
Method Illuminate\View\View::__toString() must not throw an exception, caught ErrorException: Unexpected character "&".
```

I ran into this error after I wrote a [custom Twig plugin][twcp] to get an image from its slug, and output a custom bit of HTML for lazy loading and prettier display ([Thanks to PyroCMS 3 it is very easy to make a custom Twig plugin!][pyroplugin]).

The error occured when I rendered the [Markdown field in PyroCMS 3][mdf] like this:

```html
<div>{{ guide.content.parse()|markdown|raw }}</div>
```

## The Solution
**You should use single quotes instead of double quotes in your Twig plugins inside the [PyroCMS Markdown Field][mdf]!**

I discovered this after trying numerous things including escaping, raw output, HTML filters and more, so there you go!

```twig
// Do This
{{ guide_image('your-image.jpg')|raw }}

// Donâ€™t Do This
{{ guide_image("your-image.jpg")|raw }}
```

This fixed it for me and I have not had any problems since!
