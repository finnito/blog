__Hikers__: Finn and Jen

This is yet _another_ route that can take you up to Mt Herbert / Te Ahu Tatiki. It's a bit interesting in that is a DOC route but you access it via Orton Bradley Park and __there is an entry fee to the park.__

> The entrance fee is $5 per adult, $1 per child, to a maximum of $10 per car load. - [Orton Bradley Website](http://www.ortonbradley.nz/#intro)

Ah well. The start of the track is quite nice through the trees and there is even a nice detour that you can do to a waterfall! After you leave the park you will see a very overgrown DOC sign which will tell you it's 2.5hrs to the Mt Herbert Shelter.

From here the track climbs more steeply through some bush. Take care through here - there was a good deal of ongaonga which is a stinging nettle which has paralytic effects. You certainly don't want to watch into a patch of it!

> ...there has been one recorded human death from contactâ€”a lightly clad hunter who died five hours after walking through a dense patch. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtica_ferox)

After the track exits the bush you will find yourself back on a 4WD farm track which zigzags up to the saddle between Mt Herbert and Mt Bradley. Take care on this track as it often gets muddly and Jen rolled her ankle really bad here. Fortunately she solidered on and we went for a really nice dinner in Diamond Harbour afterwards to improve morale ðŸ¥°
