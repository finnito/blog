[Hugo][5] is a really nice way to write a blog - your writing is stored as plain text and by using [Markdown][1] you can introduce some nice basic HTML formatting. Markdown allows you to have HTML inside the same file by adding the following flag to your `config.toml` file:

```toml
[markup.goldmark.renderer]
    unsafe=true
```

<!--more-->

However, if you want to use Hugo's functions inside HTML which is inside your Markdown file, that is not allowed. Enter, Hugo snippets  !
In your theme (mine is called `hugo-finn`) create the directory `layouts/shortcodes/` and inside this directory create a snippet file (mine is called `figure.html`).

These snippet files are special because any Hugo functions inside the snippet are parsed, before the snippet itself is parsed into the Markdown file. [Read the full shortcode documentation here][2].

Here is how I call my snippet, where `src`, `title`, and `author` are the arguments passed to the `figure.html` snippet.

```
{{</* figure src="" title="" author="" */>}}
```

And, here is how the snippet works, where the main takeaway is `{{ .Get "src" }}` is how to get an argument input!

```
<figure>
    <a href='{{ .Get "src" | absURL }}' title='Full size image: {{ .Get "title" }}'>
        <img 
            srcset='
                https://img.lesueur.nz/full?u={{ .Get "src" | absURL }} 4096w,
                https://img.lesueur.nz/2048?u={{ .Get "src" | absURL }} 2048w,
                https://img.lesueur.nz/1024?u={{ .Get "src" | absURL }} 1024w,
                https://img.lesueur.nz/512?u={{ .Get "src" | absURL }} 512w,'
            src='{{ .Get "src" | absURL }}'
            alt='{{ .Get "title" }}'
            loading="lazy"/>
    </a>
    <figcaption>(ðŸ“·: {{ .Get "author" }}) {{ .Get "title" }}</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Pretty sweet! I've even got `:figure` mapped as a text expansion shortcut so I don't have to remember the syntax each time! Click through to read about [responsively serving images with srcset][3], or click through to read about [my image resizing service, AutoImageResizer][4], head over here!

Happy developing!
