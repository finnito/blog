Somewhere during the week of May 2nd, 2022, I had the idea of setting myself the goal of doing a 100km run. Not as a race, but just a thing to do. Around this time I had a resurgence of running, a little bit at least. I was running every morning with my dog as a way to give her some activity before being confined at home while my partner and I go to work.

So, I began. I managed a few small volume weeks ~40km. It’s good to start small and manageable so that you can keep it up. It all seemed good but a couple of weeks ago it all fell apart. So soon, huh? Turns out work can be a real kick in the guts.

Time to get back on the horse and see how I go!
