Swish — swish — swish — swish
  Breathing gently in
    And Out and in
       Crunch!
       Sorry!
       Swish
     Didn’t — swish
  Mean to get — swish
You — swish — swish — swish

The packraft, yellow, bright
 against The translucent blue
    Inland, the Kāikouras
     Mitre Peak
      Mt Alarm
     Crows Nest
 And mightiest of all
    Tapuae-O-Ueniku
 A step on the journey of
Uenuku, on the way to heaven
Or, “a decent mountain at last”
  For Sir Ed. A decent mountain
         Indeed.

The water turns grey-blue from rock
  Weathering away, greywacke to loess
    Sediment carried downstream,
      Rock broken by the snow, the ice,
    The harsh weather of our home
  But today, not so harsh
The water is cold, but
our souls are warm

Swish — swish — swish — swish
  Ahead! A rock on the left
   Okay, going right
     Paddle hard
       Go, go.
        Phew.
    Another rapid
   Big boulders in the river
  Leftover from a landslide, a scar
Earthquakes shake loose the choss
     of the southern alps
         
Helmet blue, jacket red
 Lush mātai green
   Lines the river
     All quiet, save 
     The river
    The river
   The river
  Swish
 Swish
Swish
