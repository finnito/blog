This post is coming to you from a 2020 iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù - a beautiful, huge, iPad. Once upon a time in 2010 I owned a iPad 1 (thanks Dad!); I ostenstably used it for schoolwork, but I think I mostly played a tower defence game [Sentinel 3](1) while pretending to do work in Statistics.

Fast forward 10 whole years and I have finally upgraded! Now, unlike 16 year old me, I would like to make a good attempt and being productive with it. And also very unlike 16 old me, I am now a high school Science and Physics teacher at that very high school I sought to avoid work in. So, how can I be productive on this device?

## This Blog & Teaching Notes

I have previously written about [how I built this website](2), but all of that was done on my Macbook Pro. How could I do it on my iPad? I need a good Git client and possibly a SSH client, too (for debugging when things break!).

### [Working Copy](3)

[Working Copy](3) is a truly excellent git client written by Anders Borum. I bought it back when it was much cheaper, but if you are planning on doing actual work on your iPad then $34.99 is surely worth every cent. I could not recommend it enough. I have all my important repos cloned onto it so I can write, make bug fixes and even deploy!

### [Terminus](4)

Terminus is another truly great



## Physics Tutorials

## VPN & Remote Desktop
