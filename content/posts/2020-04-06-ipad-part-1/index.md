This post is coming to you from an 2020 iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù - a beautiful, huge iPad. Once upon a time in 2010 I owned a iPad 1 (thanks Dad!); I ostenstably used it for schoolwork, but I think I mostly played a tower defence game [Sentinel 3][1] while pretending to do work in Statistics.

Fast forward 10 whole years and I have finally upgraded! Now, unlike 16 year old me, I would like to make a good attempt and being productive with it. And also very unlike 16 old me, I am now a high school Science and Physics teacher at that very high school I sought to avoid work in. So, how can I be productive on this device?
