URL schemes are indispensable to anyone who uses iOS heavily and dabbles in automation. They allow users to make deep-links into apps and to automate actions using apps such as [Siri Shortcuts][ss], [Editorial][ed] or [Drafts][dr].
_Because Shortcuts is in beta until iOS 12, I will use Workflow until it is released and I can update this post._

Thankfully, the [OmniGroup][og] who is behind the incredibly flexible and powerful task manager, [OmniFocus][of], has an extensive and well-documented URL scheme! I will link to the original web pages documenting the scheme but will go through the format and usage of some of the more useful URLs. A common and user-friendly way to use URL schemes is through [Siri Shortcuts][ss] (formerly Workflow). I will give some examples of how the schemes could be used with Shortcuts and for more a more in-depth scripting usage you may refer to an [OmniForm post][ofp] written by [Ken Case][kc].

## URLs in Apple Shortcuts
In order to open a URL in [Siri Shortcuts][ss] simply place a _URL_ action and populate it with the URL you desire and follow it with a _Open URLs_ action.

### URL Structure
For those new to URL schemes on iOS, the base URL structure somewhat resembles a browser-based URL.

```
appSlug:///
```

## Deep Linking into OmniFocus

### Home Page
The most simple URL for an app is one without path or arguments. A URL of this form would simply open the home page of the app. For OmniFocus this is as follows:

```
omnifocus:///
```

### Inbox, Flagged, Projects, Nearby, Contexts & Review
These views are the main staple of any OmniFocus user and you can speed up your usage of them by creating shortcuts to them using the following schemes:

```
omnifocus:///inbox
omnifocus:///flagged
omnifocus:///projects
omnifocus:///nearby
omnifocus:///contexts
omnifocus:///review
```
It is very simple to create a Shortcut where you select which view you would like to open using a _Select from Menu_ action and a _Open URLs_ action at the end. I have made this shortcut as a demo - get it here!

### Forecast, Past, Today, Soon & Custom Perspectives
If you are keen to link to any of the perspectives built into OmniFocus or to one of your own custom perspectives, this is achieved easily like before!

```
omnifocus:///forecast
omnifocus:///past
omnifocus:///today
omnifocus:///soon
```
And if you want to link to a custom perspective that you have created (e.g. My Awesome Perspective), you can simply do this:

```
omnifocus:///perspective/My%20Awesome%20Perspective
```
One thing to note here is that if your perspective has any characters other than letters or numbers, you should URL encode it! Thankfully, [Shortcuts][ss] has an action that does just that. An example of how you might do it is below.

### Searching
You can also open up a custom search straight off the bat by using the search URL. This can easily be augmented by replacing the string below with an `Ask When Run` variable.

```
omnifocus:///search?q=string
```

_It is important to note that the 'search' string should be URL encoded as demonstrated earlier._

[Check out my example OmniFocus search flow here.][ofsearch]

### Opening a Folder
You can also simply open a folder using the folder URL much like the search URL.

```
omnifocus:///folder/folder-id
```

_It is important to note that the 'folder-id' string should be URL encoded as demonstrated earlier._

[Check out my example OmniFocus folder opening flow here.][offolder]

### Opening a Project
And following the above trend, you can also open to a project with a similar URL.

```
omnifocus:///task/task-id
```

_It is important to note that the 'task-id' string should be URL encoded as demonstrated earlier._
