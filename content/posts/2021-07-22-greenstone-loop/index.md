__Hikers:__ Finn, Jen, Francie, Justin and Neil (July 22nd, 2021)

## Day 1: In to Upper Caples Hut

<!-- TODO: add div -->

- If summer, just walk up the centre of the valley to save yourself all the climbing! Commit to the river and wet feet. This is less appetising in winter when the river is up a little and it is freezing cold.
- Surprising amount of climbing, when the net (340-470) is quite little
- Good track
- On the South side so is in the shade, but can be nice in warmer temperatures!
- Big 'ol spider in the toilet
- NZDSA Hut - Nice!! Solar lights, lots of cooking utensils, USB plugs, !!gas available!!
- Book online and pick up the key in Queenstown

## Day 2: Kay Creek Hut

<!-- TODO: add div -->

- Short, nice
- Feet got wet at the top
- Lovely forest
- Hut in the shade, and a bit drafty
- Not much firewood, but found lots of good wood back across the stream
- Good lunch spot by the large rock and cairn
- 

## Day 3: Out via Scott Basin and Creek

<!-- TODO: add div -->

- Good travel up creek, if slow when icy. We were moving 1-2km/hr.
- Keep going right to the end, a nice way up will reveal itself
- Scott Basin beautiful in the snow
- Cairns were a bit sparse (at least in the snow) up the top and down into Scott Creek
- Lots of trees down on the Scott Creek track
- Has a nice flat section in the middle, weirdly
- Beautiful snowy basins
- Follow the tussocks down to Scott Creek, they go the whole way down to the first orange triangle
- It took 1:45 to descend Scott Creek Track
