For almost two years I wore an Apple Watch Series 2 every day. I did the morning and evening charging dance so that I could use it for both sleep tracking during the night and sport recording during the day. There is a lot that I really liked (and still do) about the Apple Watch.

- It is a nice piece of jewellery,
- it is customisable,
- it is very well integrated with the iPhone.
