After our trip to [Camp Creek Hut](/posts/camp-creek-hut/) we stayed the night in Hokitika and had a nice time exploring the area. Part of that explore was to go to Lake Kaniere for a run! We knew there was lots of other stuff to do like run the water race, tramp to Mt Brown Hut, climb Tuhua etc. but we figured we could do with a relatively flat stretch of the legs.

We parked at the north west end of the road and headed off along the track, aiming to go about 5-6km out and then back the same way. The track was good - pretty well formed and good underfoot. There are some rocky sections through a few rivers, and being The West Coast, it was also muddy from time to time.

All in all, a solid, easy going trail run! Highly recommended. Next time we go back we'll try do a full loop of the lake, plus some of the other trails in the area! üèî
