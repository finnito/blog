We've been enjoying a little holiday to The Catlins during these school holidays - visiting many (many) waterfalls,  a little rock climbing, cycling walking and running. But, we had wanted to do something a little longer to turned our eyes towards Tautuku Hut.

[Tautuku Hut](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/otago/places/catlins-coastal-area/things-to-do/tautuku-hut/) is one of the few huts in the region, and being just off the main road, and about 4km from the road-end, it is an excellent day walk or overnighter. It is free to stay at, and maintained by [Permolat Southland](https://permolatsouthland.nz/home/huts-and-tracks/hut-list/tautuku-hut/)

The track has an elevation gain of around ~365m on the round trip, making it not too strenuous for the less-fit people out there. The track is extremely well marked, with plentiful orange triangles. It is however, quite muddy. I think this is expected for Southland, though! If you know that going in, you'll have quite a nice time. It took us ~45min to run in, and about ~40min to run out. So, all in all, a great wee-trip!
