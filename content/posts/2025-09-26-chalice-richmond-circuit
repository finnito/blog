## Day 0: Lake Chalice Hut

In the morning I dropped Korra 🐕 to the kennels before we packed the car and headed north to Belnheim (and beyond!). The weather was looking dicey for much of the island, but the Richmond Ranges looked to escape the worst of it. There might be some rain, but nowhere near as bad as the West Coast and The Divide.

Needing somewhere to stay for the night, and not minding a short side-quest, we parked up a very long forestry road and quickly walked the 2.5km, 400m descent track to Lake Chalice Hut. The track is wide and well-formed and was quick going, only taking us about 30min for the descent.

We originally considered walking around the lake that evening but when a little bit of drizzled blew in, we opted for a short trip to the lake and to light the fire in the hut.

## Day 1: To Old Man Hut

In the morning we ate a quick breakfast and hiked back up the way we came in about 45 minutes. From there, we drove down to ___ picnic area where we parked the car and got started our main hike. Side-quest completed! 

From the picnic area the track is very relaxed, however, our packs were nothing of the short! We had 8 days of food (gotta extra just in case), plus our heavier winter clothes and sleeping bags. About 1hr in we reached the so-called “Forks Route” junction. From the junction the tracks continues fairly reasonably, climbing in-and-out of creeks and around a slip. We lunched at the very nice waterfall just over 1km from the main climb.

The face of the climb is unrelenting and rather steep, made especially so by our unaccustomed pack weight. Still, plodding on things get easier after point 1056, but there are still sharp pinches where it continues to be very steep. The track is not particularly formed, but is very well parked. Orange triangles abound. 

Once you reach the saddle on the ridge-line between Old Man and point 1522 the tracks becomes much more defined. The same trend continues once Old Man is reached. There is also a water barrel near the summit, too. Ideal for the hotter and dryer months.

For us, it was now raining (or were we just in windy cloud? It’s hard to tell). We quickly got off the summit and headed across to Old Man Hut. The track is well formed, but there is the odd uphill and a couple of small partially exposed rock clambers. These would probably not be very fun in the snow!

We found the hut empty, a trend that would continue for the rest of the trip. We quickly lit the fire, got changed into dry clothes, scoffed a pile of food and climbed into bed. It had been a big first day.

## Day 2: To Slaty Hut

It was a grey day when we woke, but not actively raining–which is always a bonus. We tidied the hut (of course) and headed back up the steep and rooty access trail to “The Alpine Route”. At the top we were back in the wind, so popped on our jackets and powered off back along the ridge past Old Man and onward to Slaty Hut.

There is a sharp scree-y descent off Old Man to a nicely forested saddle before the very pleasant Ada Flats. We looked east from there, spying the untracked ridge line I had originally planned us to take from Mt Richmond to Ada Flats. We were had we weren’t doing that this trip. Maybe another time. With smaller bags. In summer.

From Ada Flats there is one final climb before sidling below Slaty Peak to the hut. Which, by the way, is adorable. Through a short break in the weather we saw Mt Rintoul to the south-west and recalled our previous trip and how we were also in the cloud and missed out on the promised excellent views. Alas.

The hut is in great condition and had a large woodshed, which looks like it has had an animal sleeping in amongst the sticks. We spent an hour or so collecting and cutting wood before heading in to read our books. It was a very windy night and more rain came through than we were expecting, so I decided to try get a weather forecast the next day.

## Day 3: To Browning Hut

We headed off in good spirits, knowing there wouldn’t be quite as much uphill today. Thank goodness! If we had realised how our quads would feel after 1100m+ of descent, maybe we would have thought differently.

I got a quick forecast update when we popped into reception on the north side of Slaty Peak before powering on. We found great resistance to our speed in the form of a blustery headwind which made it hard to stand or walk in a straight line at times when crossing by Mt Starveall. We were pleased to greet Starveall Hut which was a tad more sheltered not too long after leaving the summit. We discussed the weather forecast and decided we would push on to Browning Hut, 1.25hr past Hacket Hut (our original destination). This would, we reasoned, allow us to skip Rocks Hut and go straight to Middy Hut, thus gaining us a day.

The descent from Starveall to Hacket Creek is steeper than it looks on Topo, and quite unrelenting. Nothing emphasised this more than the man we passed who was heading uphill who said it felt “endless”. Sorry, mate, you have a couple of hours to go.

We travelled along Hacket Creek for some time, crossing frequently and doing our best to not slip on the lichen-covered rocks. We were both feeling a bit sore and grouchy and were more than pleased to reach Hacket Hut, situated on a nice big clearing in the sun. Delightful.

From there, we reached Browning Hut in about an hour. The track is well-formed and the low river route is certainly passable, despite the graffiti on the DOC sign. The last kilometre climbs steadily up a 4WD-width track before reaching the hut.

We had plenty of afternoon left, so foraged and chopped a lot of work with an _excellent_ hand-saw (not something you can often say about tramping hut saws). The hut itself lost the sun fairly early due to the tree, but we sat on the woodshed edge and read our books in the sun until it was time for dinner.

## Day 4: To Middy Hut

We were supposed to get up at 7am, but I stuffed up setting an alarm and we both snoozed until 8:30am. Whoops. We packed and ate quickly and headed off. It was a short but steep climb Tōtara Saddle where we got yet another forecast update–boy is it useful to have intermittent cell service when the weather is dicey.

From the saddle we turned north, sticking to the Te Araroa trail to Rocks Hut. The trail meanders up and down from point to point, often popping out onto rounded and tussocked tops, and dropping down into mature forest. I was struck by the size of the trees in some sections!

Jen was out front setting a punishing pace. She didn’t want to spend 8 hours (DOC time) walking. In the end, it would take us just over 5 hours. Plenty of time for rest! We ate lunch in the sun at a picnic table outside Rocks Hut and drank coffee from the thermos before taking the short and direct trail down to the valley floor.

The trail down is mostly quite nice. It is steep in parts and relatively moderate in others, but is quite rooty the whole way down. I wondered if that was because the ground is easily eroded, leaving the roots visible, or if they grow near the surface to inhibit erosion and thus ensure support for the tree. I’ll have to find a botanist to ask!

Right near the hut is a great swing bridge across the Pelorus River, situated above what looks like an amazing swimming hole. By the time we got settled into the hut and foraged and cut more wood, the day had cooled off and we no longer felt like a dip. Perhaps another time in midsummer!

## Day 5: To Mt Fell Hut

5:45am, the alarm goes off. We roll out of bed, inhale breakfast, and coffee we prepared the night before. On go the hiking clothes, coffee for the thermos gets made, the wraps get pre-made.

6:30am, the hut is tidy, headlights are on heads, and backpacks are on. We are off! We trot down the track and quickly find the turn off for the Middy to Mt Fell Route, although, not before Jen heads back to the hut to check under the bed for something that fell on the floor.

From the turnoff, the track climbs unrelenting and very steeply through a series of zig-zags up 700m to point 900. From here it generally eases off, alternating between beautiful forested saddles and ridges, and sharp pinches of 100-200m climbing. The final climb to Conical Knob was especially steep.

As we approached the chain ladder and point 1496 the westerly wind picked, and a little bit of rain came in. Simultaneously, the track became more exposed to it. Still, we had plenty of warm clothes left to put on and felt safe continuing. That was until the Westpac Rescue Helicopter turned up and circled nearby us, watched us climb the chain ladder and hovered just west of 1496. We tried to wave hi and give the “ok” symbol, but we’re still unsure what they were doing. It was a little disconcerting, though! I checked my Garmin inReach to ensure I hadn’t bumped the SOS
button. Nope, all good.

From there the track drops to a saddle marked 1411 which was really pretty, in spite of the wind and rain. We found the last climb to Mt Fell scrambly and interminable on our tired legs. The scramble was a little sketchy in the wind and rain), but nothing we were overly concerned about. We continued to be quite exposed to the westerly wind until _after_ the turnoff to the Mt Fell Hut.

In the end, we made great time and beat the worst of the weather. Both great successes in our books. We had plenty of time to eat a late lunch, forage for wood and chop it up. Previous hut-goers had left nary but a single log and a large pile of smaller sticks. We soon rectified that.

## Day 6: Rest Day

We aimed gain a day earlier in the trip so that we could have a rest day here at Mt Fell Hut. We knew our legs would be tired and, more importantly, that some rain was blowing through on Wednesday and Thursday. We didn’t want to be crossing Mt Richmond in that!

It was fairly cold overnight, with some frost inside the hut and plenty outside of it. We used much of the wood pile we had gathered the previous day so had a slow coffee and breakfast before heading out into nearby woods to collect wood. _Lots_ of it. We spent over two hours collecting and chopping wood, although much of it was too wet for immediate use and would need to dry out in the shed. 

Jen also took this opportunity to trim the tussocks sticking out onto the track to toilet and fill in some of the muddy spots with wood-chopping debris. Hopefully all of this is appreciated by future trampers!

We whiled away the rest of the day in our sleeping bags front of the fire, reading our books, drinking tea and generally relaxing. Fingers crossed for good weather on the final day out!
