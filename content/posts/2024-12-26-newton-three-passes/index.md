We started nice and early, leaving Christchurch just after 7am. Jen’s sister was staying at our to look after Korra 🐕, which was very nice of her.

## Day 1: To Newton Creek Hut

There was a good sized carpark at the Arahura and we left the car there with our new steering wheel lock attached. Since it was there for 4 nights we hoped it would deter any would-be menaces.

The track starts as described: across private land. It’s all pretty simple here, although we were already sweating! Once you cross the Cesspool and get a great view of the river (and also a potential swimming spot), the track continues to be pretty great. It is generally an old logging road so quite wide and well-formed, but often dips down into washed out creeks and across river fans. There are also a few sections of travel next to the river, but they were nothing to be concerned about.

We made great time to Lower Arahura Hut (3hrs), where we had a lovely lunch, and topped up on coffee and sunscreen. We plodded on, knowing that the harder section was to come.

There was quite a slog up an unnamed washed out creek, which was surprisingly hard work. From there the track climbed quite high above the river - to the point where it was out of sight and almost out of hearing. You cross a completely epic waterfall which comes (near vertical) crashing out of the trees and past you into the forest below. Thankfully it is not so steep that you can’t sidle through it - although, this would be a terrible idea if it has rained recently.

The turnoff for Newton Creek Hut was obvious and the track descends steeply toward the river. The swing bridge is _excellent_ and the section of track on the true right before climbing __steeply__ up to Newton Creek is picturesque in the extreme.

The climb to Newton Creek is unrelenting and probably in the range of 50-70deg at times. Hard work but over reasonably quickly. From the top it is a nice side and quick descent down to the creek before reaching the hut.

We got to the hut just before 7pm, so still had some sunlight to warm up in after a quick splash in the river to remove some of the days dirt and smells. Much too cold to get into, though!

> ☕️ Cream cheese and jam bagels; watermelon, grapes, and pineapple (leftover from Christmas).

> 🌮 Ham, tofurkey, and smoked Gouda cheese in a wrap (more leftovers).

> 🍴 Baked beans (dehydrated at home) and mashed potato (bought dehydrated).

> 🍫 A hot chocolate and some actual chocolate.

## Day 2: To Julia Hut

The day started nicely and we were out the door before 8am. The track to Newton Saddle very quickly became river travel, boulder hopping, waterfall bouldering and cutty grass bashing. It continued much the same until we got out of the scrub. From there we followed a few poles to Newton Saddle which has an amazing view 😍.

The descent into Dunns Creek was a bit naff as there wasn’t really a distinct track (to be expected). It was steep and slippery on the tussocks and wouldn’t be very fun if it were damp underfoot. The travel down Dunns Creek was much the same as the travel up from the other side, but there were a few extended sections of bush travel when the river became impassable. In the end we reached Dunns Hut after 5.5hrs and were very pleased to see it. It has recently been done up and looked awesome, even sporting a couple of double-glazed windows.

From Dunns Hut the travel was quite nice (if a bit boggy) to the saddle just below pt. 824. The descent down to Mid Taipo Hut was a bit tough after having _just_ done Newton Saddle, but we made it to Mid Taipo in about 1hr 50min, which is just shy of the 2hrs indicated by the sign. Pretty pleased with that!

The track to Julia Hut starts as a bit of a highway, being 4WD width and well-formed. It becomes slightly less nice after the bridge across the Taipo, but still completely lovely compared to Newton Saddle! I was feeling pretty pooped by this point, so was a bit mopey. It was a bit of a slog up to the hut, but we made it clocking in at 11hrs door to door (with about 1hr stopping time). 

The hut was unfortunately full, so we pitched the tent, made some dinner (burned both our tongues) and climbed into bed around 9:15pm. Big day in the office and properly a bigger one tomorrow!

> ☕️ Muesli & instant coffee with dehy oat milk. 

> 🌮 Tuna, avocado and smoked Gouda in a wrap.

> 🍴 Dehydrated bolognaise with an avocado that got squished (RIP). 

> 🍫 A hot chocolate and some actual chocolate.

## Day 3: To Park Morpeth Hut

What a day! We woke early but forgot the admin of packing down a tent and didn’t hit the track until 8am. For the first few kilometres it was very nice, well-formed and in beautiful bush. We even saw another three whio!

After some time enters the creek, but the travel is _much_ easier than anything Newton or Dunns creeks had to offer, so we felt good about that. Also, the “markers” are dazed and confused: you should basically ignore them once you are on the river and just go where looks the best to you.

We did, unfortunately, miss the turnoff for the track to Harman Pass. But, we blame the orange triangle on the opposite side of the creek upstream of the turnoff. Crazy!
Having backtracked and sent it straight up the hillside to intercept the track, the rest of the ascent to Harman Pass was totally fine (if steep).

We cruised along until just above one of the beautiful tarns and had lunch, also opting to dry out the sopping-wet tent from the morning dew. From there, the travel was pretty good - some boulders hopping up to the snowfields on the East side of White Horn Pass. We put on our micro spikes (thanks, Neil and Becky!) and headed on up. We passed a lone hiker whose two friends had absconded to climb a nearby peak. They were intending to meet back up and reach Park Morpeth Hut later (yikes!).

The view was absolutely stunning over both of the passes, and looking down into Cronin Steam was a bit intimidating but the track was actually great. We didn’t find it at all sketchy and managed to get on to a good trail well above the river (thanks, Remote Huts!). We powered past a group of three who were plodding away down near the creek and stuck to the true left, looking out for the promised tarn and orange marker to get back onto a track. It came much later than we thought, but we found it in the end. From there it was a straightforward amble to the hut along a well-formed track (as promised).

We claimed our beds for the night, dropped our packs and headed to the Wilberforce for a greatly needed and well-earned clean. We both washed our tops and I washed my shorts, but the sun went down and only time will tell if they dry over night.

> ☕️ Muesli & instant coffee with dehy oat milk.
> 🌮 Tuna, avocado and smoked Gouda in a wrap.
> 🍴 Mushroom and cannelloni bean ragu (dehydrated at home) and mashed potato (bought dehydrated).
> 🍫 A hot chocolate and some actual chocolate.

## Day 4: To Mudflats Hut

We started early, having had very poor sleep: the climbers got in around 11pm, it was super warm, and there was a snorer in the hut. We trotted out, looking forward to the shorter day, slightly cooler temperatures and lots of time to read our books in the hut. The travel was straightforward to the bottom of Browning Pass, and the zig-zags mostly made sense, except for when they didn’t. When we lost them, we tended to go straight up until we could find another snow pole. The last few hundred meters were _very_ steep and would be quite challenging to go down. They are exposed on loose rock and poor visibility of where to go.

Browning Lake / Whakarewa is super beautiful but I struggled to get a good photo of it (lens wasn’t wide enough). The trail goes around the side of the lake and then descends down to the creek below. The track is all really good through here and we didn’t have any problems, which made for a nice change. The river travel was also pretty good - you don’t need to cross the creek until quite near the access track. That said, just like the rest of this trip: you can mostly go where works best for you as long as you are going in the right direction.

We hit Harman Hut at midday, perfect time for an early lunch (compared to previous days). There we met two hunters who were out for a nice big trip. We trucked on but I was having a sad time with my feet - they had swelled and were starting to rub in new places. Not a fan! After some morale boosting snacks we plodded on, the track getting better and better. As we neared Mud Flats Hut it started to spit, but thankfully it didn’t start pouring until we reached the hut.

We claimed our beds and were thankful to have been there first because a party of 5 turned up shortly after, and then three more who were at Park Morpeth with us the prior night. Two cups of tea, dinner, a hot chocolate and some chocolate later we were ready for sleep.

> ☕️ Muesli & instant coffee with dehy oat milk.

> 🌮 Tuna and smoked Gouda in a wrap.

> 🍴 2x packets of spicy noodles

> 🍫 A hot chocolate and some actual chocolate.
